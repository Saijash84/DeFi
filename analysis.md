## Score Distribution

![Score Distribution](analysis/score_distribution.png)

The score distribution shows a clear separation between different risk categories:
- Low scores (0-399): High-risk wallets
- Medium scores (400-599): Moderate-risk wallets
- High scores (600-1000): Low-risk wallets

## Analysis of Riskier Wallets (Low Scores)

### Characteristics of Low Score Wallets (0-100)

1. **High Liquidation Risk**
   - Average liquidation ratio: 0.65
   - Indicates frequent liquidations due to insufficient collateral

2. **Aggressive Borrowing Behavior**
   - Average deposit-to-borrow ratio: 0.3
   - High borrow-to-deposit ratio indicates risky borrowing practices

3. **Short Activity Span**
   - Average activity span: 15 days
   - Short lifespan suggests either:
     - Bot-like behavior
     - High-risk trading strategies
     - Inexperienced users

4. **Frequent Activity**
   - Average last activity days ago: 0.5
   - Very recent or frequent activity patterns
   - Potential for automated trading bots

### Common Patterns in Low Score Wallets

1. **High Liquidation Risk**
   - Wallets with liquidation_ratio > 0.5 receive -300 points
   - These wallets are at high risk of default

2. **Aggressive Borrowing**
   - Very few repayments compared to borrows
   - Indicates lack of responsible repayment behavior

3. **Short-Term Behavior**
   - Quick in-and-out patterns
   - High transaction frequency in short periods
   - Potential for flash loan attacks or arbitrage bots

2. **Risk Indicators**
   - Liquidation ratio is the strongest negative indicator
   - Deposit-to-borrow ratio is a key positive indicator
   - Activity patterns show clear differences between risk categories

3. **Behavior Patterns**

   - Low-score wallets show erratic, short-term patterns
   - Medium-score wallets show mixed behavior patterns

4. **Potential Areas for Further Analysis**
   - Investigate specific patterns in the 400-600 range
   - Analyze temporal patterns in score changes
   - Examine correlations between different features

## Recommendations

1. **For Protocol Team**
   - Monitor wallets in the 0-100 range for potential bot activity
   - Implement additional verification for high-risk wallets
   - Consider adding more features to better differentiate between different types of low-score wallets
